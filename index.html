        <h2>About</h2>
        <div style="margin: 0 auto;">
        <p>After graduating Arizona Automotive institute I started to work for Toyota and quickly moved up in companies to Porsche and Mercedes. I do love the technical side of cars and how intricate they can be, but the few years I was in the automotive field I quickly learned this was not something I was passionate about. Being good at something and being passionate are very different things.</p>
          <p>
            All that is what lead me to my current path attending ThinkFul. I have always loved computers and it has always been a passion of mine to understand how everything works with technology. I started to learn how to code on my own with Python, but I wanted more of a structure and an even better foundation. I did a lot of research, and ThinkFul beat out all the competition. My mind was made up it is time to start doing what I love. </p>
          <p>If you are looking for a new developer who has alot of ambition please reach out! I am very exited to enter the world of tech and to build projects to better the lives of others. </p>
